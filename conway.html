		<h1> Conway's Game of Life </h1>
		<p>
			Each cell in the grid has two possible states, dead and alive. In each new generation, the configuration of cells determines which ones live or die. See <a href = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life> this link </a> for more information.
		</p> 

		<h4> Rules </h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				A living cell with fewer than 2 or greater than 3 live neighbors will die.
			</li>
			<li>
				A living cell with either two or three neighbors will survive into the next generation.
			</li>
			<li>
				A Dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors will become alive.
			</li>
		</ul> 
		
		<p>
			Click a square to toggle it's state between dead and alive. After pressing start, the automation begins, and each successive generation is computed and displayed.<br/><br/>
			This page is a work in progress.
